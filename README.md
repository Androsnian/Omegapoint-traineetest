An implementation of The Luhn algorithm, or Luhn formula, to check whether a user chosen identification number is a Swedish personal identity number, organization number or coordination number. I decided that instead of asking the user to pick whether it was a specific number and do the validity check for just that kind of number I would do it as a bigger check for all three. The program starts by asking the user for how many numbers will be validated for that session (or, how many loops will happen) and then repeatedly ask for an identification number that will be tested. After being tested the number is saved in an arraylist, and after all numbers have been entered the program gives feedback on all numbers, writing out their original state, whether they are valid (according to The Luhn algorithm) and what kind of number it was (coordination number for example.

Something that could be added for the future is a check to see if the user writes some kind of wrong information into the program, for example it will now crash if the user writes "a" when it asks for an int to know how many loops it should do.
